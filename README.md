# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
```
/*
Program to find the exponentiation of a number.
Developed by: A.Sai Bandhavi
RegisterNumber: 21005573
*/
```
def fun(k):

    print("Exponentiation of a given number:",k**2)

k=int(input())

fun(k)


## Output:
![exponentiation of a number](https://github.com/Saibandhavi75/EXPONENTIATION/blob/main/2021-12-22%20(1).png?raw=true)


## Result:
Thus the program to find the exponentiation of a given number is written and verified using python programming.
